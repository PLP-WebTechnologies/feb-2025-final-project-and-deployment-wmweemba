                    <p>Hi, My Name Is <strong>William</strong>. Iâ€™m a computer network professional (BSc)  currently working in the financial sector as a network engineer. My career has been shaped by my very first job right out of university working for an Internet Service Provider (ISP).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Iâ€™ve always been interested in technology and have been fascinated by computers as far back as I can remember. So I decided to study computer science at university. I wound up in the Computer Networking space after my studies. I realized that after a few years of work I was frustrated by how slow my career growth was.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I knew there must be a better way to keep growing and maintaining forward movement in my career. I decided to learn how to improve myself and make myself more marketable in the industry. I needed a way to boost my career.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Using Industry Certifications like CISCO CCNA, I have learned how to gain knowledge that is valued in the industry. The Certifications also assure employers and colleagues in the industry that I possess the right skills for the job. That is the power of internationally recognized industry certifications from companies like CISCO, Juniper, CompTIA, and Oracle.</p>
                    <br>
