                            "Are you a CISCO or Juniper person? Have you ever wondered what certain commands look like 
                            in CISCO‚Äôs IOS, or in Juniper‚Äôs Junos? This article covers 10 common network engineering 
                            commands and compares the CISCO vs Juniper version. Tasks 1. Change Host-Name Every device has 
                            a device name or hostname. This is an easy way to know which device you are currently logged 
                            into. Most network administrators give their network devices hostnames that describe what device 
                            it is and what it does. Think of a core router located at your main office, you could use a hostname 
                            like ‚ÄúCORE-RTR-HQ‚Äù. The more descriptive the name, the better. 
                            CISCO Router(config)# hostname CORE-RTR-HQCORE-RTR-HQ(config)# Note how the prompt changes 
                            from ‚ÄúRouter‚Äù to ‚ÄúCORE-RTR-HQ‚Äù which is the new hostname. Juniper root@# set host-name

                            "Introduction Using Netflow to understand your network and get the best performance from your network. 
                            What is Network Netflow? Netflow is a network protocol that collects information about network traffic 
                            that is flowing through a network device‚Äôs interface. Netflow was originally created by CISCO to 
                            collect flow data on CISCO devices. These days other vendors have their own versions of the Netflow 
                            protocol on their devices. For example, Juniper has j-flow and Huawei has NetStream and S-Flow, etc. 
                            Netflow collects data, called flows that are moving through an interface. Flows are a collection of 
                            network information exchanged by almost all network devices. Collected flows are sent to a device that 
                            can analyze this data. Once collected and analyzed, flows can then be presented in a way that is useful
